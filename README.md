# Research Task 09 – Syracuse Housing Code Violations & Vacancy Analysis

## Project Overview
This capstone project analyzes housing code violations and vacant property trends
in the City of Syracuse using public datasets from the Syracuse Open Data portal.
The goal is to identify neighborhood-level patterns that may inform housing policy,
inspection prioritization, and community planning.

## Problem Statement
Housing code violations and vacant properties can negatively impact neighborhood
safety, property values, and quality of life. While Syracuse publishes relevant
datasets, they are difficult for non-technical audiences to interpret. This project
transforms raw civic data into clear, actionable insights for city stakeholders.

## Data Sources
All data is sourced from https://data.syr.gov and accessed via API when possible.
Example datasets include:
- Housing Code Violations
- Vacant Property Registry
- Property Inspections
- Neighborhood and geographic boundaries

No personally identifying information (PII) is included or committed to this repository.

## Technical Approach
- Data access via Syracuse Open Data APIs
- Data cleaning and transformation using Python (Pandas / Polars)
- Exploratory data analysis and trend detection
- Neighborhood-level aggregation and comparison
- Visualizations using Plotly, Folium, or Tableau
- Optional LLM-assisted summaries for non-technical audiences (clearly labeled)

## Deliverables
- Reproducible analysis code
- Interactive dashboard or analytical report
- Technical and methodology documentation
- Stakeholder-friendly summary of findings
